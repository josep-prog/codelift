# **CodeLift (CL) Lifting New Programmers Up**

## **Introduction & Problem Statement**

Learning programming can be an overwhelming journey, especially for students who are beginners or junior programmers. Many struggle to know where to start, what to focus on, and how to practice consistently. While AI has become a valuable tool in software development, it has inadvertently created dependency among beginners, making coding feel intimidating or inaccessible. Students often rely on AI for answers rather than building their own understanding, which results in fear when facing coding interviews, assessments, or real-life problem-solving. Moreover, peer-to-peer learning opportunities are scarce, and beginners rarely have access to a structured community where they can grow alongside more experienced peers. This gap leaves many students without the foundational skills and confidence necessary to pursue programming seriously or to explore advanced fields like machine learning.

## **Solution Statement**

CodeLift (CL) is established to address this gap by creating a collaborative, supportive learning environment where students learn together and strengthen their coding skills practically. The club is not a conventional teaching platform but a space for shared learning where members both give and receive knowledge, building confidence and competence. The club aims to reduce over-reliance on AI tools by teaching students to understand and solve programming challenges themselves. Through structured practice in Python, Linux, logical problem-solving, and applied projects, members develop skills necessary to succeed in technical interviews, internships, and real-world development. For those pursuing machine learning, CodeLift introduces the mathematical foundations and practical applications required to excel, ensuring a seamless progression from foundational coding to applied specialization.

## **Mission & Vision**

### **Project Concept: CodeLift Student Dashboard with Grades and Individual Accountability**

The CodeLift Student Dashboard is a **centralized, role-based digital platform** designed to enhance learning, assessment, and participation for both students and administrators. Its main purpose is to provide a structured, interactive environment where students are actively engaged in learning, completing assignments, taking quizzes, and building real-world projects, while ensuring that **all work is individually accountable and graded**. By creating a system that mirrors a professional classroom environment, the dashboard fosters discipline, independence, and collaboration without allowing some students to rely entirely on others’ work.

At the core of the system is a **single login page**, which directs users to their respective dashboards based on their assigned roles: **administrators** or **students**. Each role has tailored functionalities to support their responsibilities and learning needs.

#### **Administrator Dashboard**

The administrator dashboard is a comprehensive management hub consisting of **five main pages**:

1. **Assignments & Quizzes** – Administrators can create, manage, and monitor both assignments and quizzes. This page is divided into two subpages: *Assignments* and *Quizzes*. When adding a new task, the admin specifies the target group (Phase 1 or Phase 2), sets the title, provides a detailed description, attaches necessary documents, and adds instructions. Each assignment includes a **submission feature** prompting students to submit a **public GitHub repository** containing their code and a **YouTube video link** showing their coding process with voice explanation and screen share. Video submissions must not exceed five minutes, ensuring concise and demonstrable work. For quizzes, a **start button triggers a screen-sharing prompt**, and the admin sets a **timer** to ensure the coding exercise is completed within the designed time limit. Unlike assignments, quizzes are strictly timed and automatically monitored for fairness.

2. **Submissions** – This page tracks all student submissions, including GitHub repositories and video links, allowing admins to verify individual contributions and ensure that every participant actively engages with the task.

3. **Gradings** – Admins can assign grades for each student based on both the code and the demonstration video. This system ensures fairness by requiring **individual work**, preventing situations where only a subset of students completes a collaborative project while others remain passive.

4. **Attendance** – Attendance is tracked for each student, giving admins insights into engagement and participation levels.

5. **Student Classification** – Administrators can categorize students by program phase (Phase 1 or Phase 2), enabling precise assignment distribution, grading, and attendance tracking.

#### **Student Dashboard**

The student dashboard focuses on **learning, progress, and accountability**. Each student accesses **three main pages**:

1. **Assignments** – Students can view, download, and submit assignments. Each task includes the title, description, due date, attached documents, and instructions. Submission requires two elements: a public GitHub repository link and a YouTube video showing the student writing and explaining their code in real time. This dual submission ensures that every student demonstrates understanding and active participation.

2. **Projects** – All projects, even collaborative ones, are individually graded. Students access the project guidelines, submission timelines, and shared resources, but **each participant must submit their own work** to guarantee personal accountability. This approach prevents unequal contribution and encourages every student to develop practical skills.

3. **Attendance** – Students can track their attendance and participation, ensuring they meet program requirements and maintain engagement throughout the course.

#### **Phase-Based Structure**

The system ensures students are correctly classified by **program phase**. Phase 1 students receive beginner-level assignments, focusing on Python fundamentals, Linux basics, and problem-solving exercises, while Phase 2 students receive advanced tasks incorporating machine learning concepts, mathematics for ML, and applied projects. This separation allows admins to assign appropriate challenges, set deadlines, monitor progress, and grade students accurately based on their current learning stage.

#### **Learning and Assessment Philosophy**

This dashboard emphasizes **individual accountability, fair grading, and practical learning**. By combining GitHub and video submissions, timed quizzes, and graded projects, the platform mirrors real-life coding assessments and professional development scenarios. Students gain confidence in writing code independently, explaining their thought process, and demonstrating mastery, reducing overreliance on AI tools. Administrators benefit from streamlined workflows, visibility into student progress, and structured tools to manage assignments, quizzes, grades, attendance, and project tracking.

In summary, the CodeLift Student Dashboard is a **practical, organized, and interactive platform** that integrates learning, assessment, and accountability. It supports both beginner and advanced students, ensures fair grading for all work, provides visibility for administrators, and ultimately prepares students to excel in coding interviews, applied projects, and advanced technology specializations.
